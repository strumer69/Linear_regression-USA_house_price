# Linear_regression-USA_house_price

## Linear Regression with Python

* This repository contains Python code for training and evaluating a linear regression model on a dataset of housing prices in the USA.
*  The code uses the scikit-learn library for building the model and computing evaluation metrics.

### Dependencies
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* 
### Dataset

The data set used is USA_Housing.csv. It contains the following columns:

* Avg. Area Income: Average income of residents of the city the house is located in.
* Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in the same city.
* Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms for houses in the same city.
* Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms for houses in the same city.
* Area Population: Population of city the house is located in.
* Price: Price that the house sold for.
* Address: Address for the house.



### Methodology

The code follows the following methodology:
* Reading in the data set using pandas.
* Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset using seaborn and matplotlib.
* Splitting the data set into a training set and a testing set using scikit-learn.
* Training a linear regression model on the training set using scikit-learn.
* Evaluating the performance of the model on the testing set using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
* Making predictions on a single sample using the trained model.
