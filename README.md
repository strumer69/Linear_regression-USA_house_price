# **Linear Regression: USA House Price Prediction**  

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict house prices in the USA based on various real estate features. The dataset includes factors such as house size, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The goal is to build a simple yet effective regression model to understand the relationships between these features and house prices.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **`Regression_USA_House_Price.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.  

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data visualization and statistical insights into housing features.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
- **Linear Regression Model**: Training and evaluating a simple regression model.  
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Includes Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) for assessment.  

## 🛠 Requirements  
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/strumer69/Linear_regression-USA_house_price.git
   cd Linear_regression-USA_house_price
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Regression_USA_House_Price.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook step by step to explore the data and train the model.  

## 📈 Results  
- The trained **Linear Regression** model provides insights into how different features influence house prices.  
- Performance is evaluated using **R² score** and **MSE**, providing an indication of prediction accuracy.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Use **multiple regression models** (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) to improve predictions.  
- Implement **feature engineering** for better model performance.  
- Extend analysis using **non-linear models** (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests).
